All students should have an SSH client installed.
Please follow the directions below to install an SSH client for your system.

## Windows

Install MobaXterm from [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).
You will want to get the Home edition (Installer edition).

## macOS

Although macOS comes with SSH pre-installed, 
you will likely want to install [XQuartz](www.xquartz.org) to enable graphical support.
Note that you must restart your computer to complete the installation.

## Linux

Linux users do not need to install anything, you should be set!
