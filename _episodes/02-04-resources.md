We now know virtually everything we need to know about getting stuff on a cluster.
We can log on, submit different types of jobs, use preinstalled software, 
and install and use software of our own.
What we need to do now is use the systems effectively.

## Estimating required resources

Although we covered requesting resources from the scheduler earlier,
how do we know how much and what type of resources we will need in the first place?
